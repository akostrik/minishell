TO DO:

norm!!!!

(want to mute make libft by adding @ to the libft Makefile)

priority goes from redirection then pipes, redirection are with their commands

accept absolute path for cmds (why relative path work but not absolute)

$? when a builtin cmd does not fail after a cmd failed isn’t reset to 0 (happened with echo

cmd not found does not update the $? to 127

after ctrl-\ update the $? to 0 (in general should update it after signals)

when exit or ctrl + D, bash prints “exit\n” and exits, to verify

when ctrl-C after yes sometimes double $ (= double readline) after that if i yes, then yes again the second yes doesnt work but the third does 
-> the first readline after ctrl-c works weirdly, not taken into account same for crtl-D

yes | head doesn’t work, not even in the history 

cat | ls doesn’t work, doesnt ls and loops -> it does ls after ctrl-C

echo $? didn’t appear in history after last cmd (cat | ls)

echo machine             prout | wc -c 	-> output 15 when it should be 14
even with option -n it should be 13 but still is 15

echo machine\n             prout	-> should write “machinen prout” but writes “machine\n prout”

first input valgrind error (see image at the end in ERRORS)
need multiple ctrl-D to get out during valgrind depending on how many cmd I used, normal ?
don’t think it’s normal because exit works normally
(see leaks at the end in LEAKS)

in fork, doesnt close fd nicely, 4 open fd at exit not nice, fd 6 (/dev/pts/0) stays open (opened by dup in initcmd), need to close it in childrens before execve and after finished executing line in parent 

not sure about the rule for unclosed quotes and special characters, should we do as now just error msg or consider them as normal characters ?

“echo test |” without quotes should probably return an error

export t="hat" doesn’t work but works without quotes for hat

cat $t > env variable not found, doll conversion not found, Segmentation fault (core dumped)
i think it’s because he couldn’t find this env var but it should just not write anything if it doesnt exist

< $t wc -c doesnt work, doesnt give any output, just newline, not even in history

< hat wc -c doesnt work and segfault (see pagina 10 for valgrind details about this) hat is a  file

useless space first char in output of echo -n

why does pressing return key gives unclosed quotes error should just display a new prompt on a new line 

“” empty string, segfault, should cmd not found -> page 11 for valgrind

only spaces segfault, it should just display a new prompt on a nl, but “ “ does not segfault and just cmd not found -> page 11 for valgrind

cat fichier1 | grep oui | grep non > fichier2 | wc -l does not what it should, should output 0 but act like wc -l at the end is not part of the pipe
-> anything that ask for input acts like that	

after every cmd not found, need to exit as many times to actually exit, the same for ctrl-D 

need to change $_ to the path (or just the cmd) of the last extern command

exit without numeric argument should still exits with error written
need to see everything related to exit actually

multiple heredoc segfault

when export env var they appear at the end of env, in bash it’s random ?

changing env var without export does not work

cd failure should display perror just ??

cd no such file or directory -> $? = 1

pwd exit code update

when unset PATH, error should just be no such or directory but it’s env var not found

echo chat > file.txt > file.txt > file.txt does not work, multiple redirection same file ??
-> redirections in builtin are bugged, the dup2 is done and not undone at the end so it stays like that in minishell

>> append redirection just don’t work ? or echo with redirection ? 

cat | cat | ls doesn’t behave how it should

open files in order and first that has a error the cmd is cancelled

infiles are opened after forks with their command if there is a pipe, so even if there is error (like file or directory not found) the next command in the pipe still works
